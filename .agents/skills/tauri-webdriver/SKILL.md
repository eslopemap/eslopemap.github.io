## The Problem

Tauri apps use WKWebView on macOS. Unlike Linux (WebKitWebDriver) and Windows (Edge WebDriver), Apple does not provide a WebDriver implementation for WKWebView. This means Tauri developers cannot run automated e2e tests on macOS using standard WebDriver tools like WebDriverIO or Selenium.

This is a blocker for any Tauri app with platform-specific code (e.g., deep links, native menus, file associations) that must be tested on every platform.

## The Solution

`tauri-webdriver` provides two crates that together bridge the gap:

1. **[`tauri-plugin-webdriver-automation`](https://crates.io/crates/tauri-plugin-webdriver-automation)** -- A Tauri plugin that runs inside your app (debug builds only). It starts a local HTTP server that can interact with your app's webview: find elements, click buttons, read text, manage windows, and execute JavaScript.

2. **[`tauri-webdriver-automation`](https://crates.io/crates/tauri-webdriver-automation)** (CLI binary: `tauri-wd`) -- A standalone CLI binary that implements the [W3C WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/). It launches your Tauri app, connects to the plugin's HTTP server, and translates standard WebDriver commands into plugin API calls. WebDriverIO, Selenium, or any W3C-compatible client can connect to it.

```
WebDriverIO/Selenium                 tauri-wd CLI                Your Tauri App
  (test runner)        ──HTTP──>    (W3C WebDriver)   ──HTTP──>  (plugin server)
                        :4444                                     :{dynamic port}
```

## Who Is This For?

- **Tauri app developers** who need automated e2e tests on macOS
- **CI/CD pipelines** that run tests and need a macOS solution
- **Anyone with platform-specific Tauri code** that must be verified on macOS (deep links, native APIs, system integrations)

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the plugin to your Tauri app

```sh
cd src-tauri
cargo add tauri-plugin-webdriver-automation
```

Register it in your app (debug builds only):

```rust
let mut builder = tauri::Builder::default();
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
{
    builder = builder.plugin(tauri_plugin_webdriver_automation::init());
}
```

### 2. Install the CLI

```sh
cargo install tauri-webdriver-automation
```

### 3. Configure WebDriverIO

```js
// wdio.conf.mjs
export const config = {
    port: 4444,
    capabilities: [{
        'tauri:options': {
            binary: './src-tauri/target/debug/my-app',
        }
    }],
    // ... your test config
};
```

### 4. Start your frontend dev server

If your Tauri app uses a dev server (Vite, Next.js, etc.), it must be running before `tauri-wd` launches your app. The debug binary loads your frontend from `devUrl` (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`), not from embedded files.

```sh
# Keep this running in a separate terminal (adjust for your setup)
npx vite --port 5173          # Vite
# npx next dev --port 3000    # Next.js
# npx webpack serve            # Webpack
```

To have your agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc) handle this automatically, add a note to your project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Starting a dev server on a port that's already in use may prompt interactively and hang automated tools, so check first and only start if needed:

```md
## WebDriver Automation
The Tauri debug binary loads the frontend from devUrl. Before launching
the app with tauri-wd, ensure these are running:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5173 > /dev/null 2>&1 || (cd apps/desktop && npx vite --port 5173 &)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4444/status > /dev/null 2>&1 || tauri-wd --port 4444 &
```

### 5. Run tests

```sh
# Terminal 1: Start the WebDriver server (supports concurrent sessions)
tauri-wd --port 4444

# Terminal 2: Run your tests
npx wdio run wdio.conf.mjs
```

## Local Disk Cleanup

Rust build artifacts can take several GB in this repo. To clean local-only files:

```sh
bash scripts/clean.sh
```

For a deeper cleanup (also removes `tests/wdio/node_modules` and generated files in `screenshots/`):

```sh
bash scripts/clean.sh --deep
```

After cleanup, the next build is slower because Rust has to recompile from scratch.

## MCP Integration

`tauri-webdriver` works with [mcp-tauri-automation](https://github.com/danielraffel/mcp-tauri-automation) to enable AI-driven automation of Tauri apps via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This lets AI agents (like Claude Code) launch, inspect, interact with, and screenshot your Tauri app through natural language.

### Setup

**1. Install the MCP server:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danielraffel/mcp-tauri-automation.git
cd mcp-tauri-automation
npm install && npm run build
```

**2. Add to Claude Code:**

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio tauri-automation \
  --scope user \
  -- node /absolute/path/to/mcp-tauri-automation/dist/index.js
```

Optionally set a default app path so you don't have to specify it every time:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio tauri-automation \
  --env TAURI_APP_PATH=/path/to/your-app/src-tauri/target/debug/your-app \
  --scope user \
  -- node /absolute/path/to/mcp-tauri-automation/dist/index.js
```

**3. Start `tauri-wd` and use with Claude:**

```sh
# Keep this running in a separate terminal
tauri-wd --port 4444
```

If your app uses a frontend dev server, make sure it's running first (see [step 4 in Quick Start](#4-start-your-frontend-dev-server)).

Then ask Claude: *"Launch my Tauri app and take a screenshot"*

> **Note:** [mcp-tauri-automation](https://github.com/danielraffel/mcp-tauri-automation) is a fork of [Radek44/mcp-tauri-automation](https://github.com/Radek44/mcp-tauri-automation) with additional tools (execute_script, get_page_title, get_page_url, multi-strategy selectors, configurable timeouts, wait_for_navigation). These additions have been [submitted upstream](https://github.com/Radek44/mcp-tauri-automation). For cross-platform MCP support, see the [original project](https://github.com/Radek44/mcp-tauri-automation).

## Supported W3C WebDriver Operations

## Architecture

Two Rust crates work together in a simple 2-hop design:

```
WebDriverIO/Selenium ──HTTP:4444──> tauri-wd CLI ──HTTP:{dynamic}──> tauri-plugin-webdriver-automation
                                    (W3C WebDriver)                   (axum server in-app)
```

**The plugin** (`tauri-plugin-webdriver-automation`) runs inside your Tauri app in debug builds. On startup it binds an [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) HTTP server to `127.0.0.1` on a random port and prints `[webdriver] listening on port {N}` to stdout. It injects a JavaScript bridge (`init.js`) into every webview that provides element finding, an async script callback mechanism, dialog interception, and an in-memory cookie store (needed because WKWebView doesn't support `document.cookie` on `tauri://` URLs). All DOM interaction happens by evaluating JS in the webview and receiving results back via Tauri IPC.

**The CLI** (`tauri-wd`) is a standalone binary that implements the W3C WebDriver HTTP protocol on port 4444. When a test framework creates a session, the CLI launches your app binary, watches stdout for the port announcement, and then translates every W3C request into a plugin HTTP call. Elements are tracked as `(selector, index, using)` triples internally, mapped to W3C UUID strings for the session lifetime. Shadow DOM elements use a separate in-memory cache since `document.querySelectorAll()` can't reach into shadow roots. Frame/iframe context is managed by a stack that scopes JS evaluation to the correct `contentDocument`.

**Session flow:** Test client sends `POST /session` with `tauri:options.binary` pointing to your app. The CLI spawns the binary with `TAURI_WEBVIEW_AUTOMATION=true`, reads the plugin port from stdout, and returns a session ID. All subsequent W3C commands are forwarded to the plugin as JSON-over-HTTP POST requests. When the session is deleted, the app process is killed.

For the full internal API reference, see [SPEC.md](https://github.com/danielraffel/tauri-webdriver/blob/main/SPEC.md).

## Alternatives

When we started building this, we were developing a macOS Tauri app and frustrated that there was no easy way to do automated e2e testing -- Apple doesn't provide a WebDriver for WKWebView. We ended up building this at roughly the same time others tackled the same problem. Probably not the greatest use of time in hindsight, but here we are.

- **[tauri-plugin-webdriver](https://github.com/Choochmeque/tauri-plugin-webdriver)** -- Open-source Tauri plugin that embeds a WebDriver server directly in the plugin (single-crate architecture vs our two-crate approach). Supports **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows** -- if you need cross-platform WebDriver support, this is the more mature choice.
- **[CrabNebula Cloud](https://docs.crabnebula.dev/plugins/tauri-e2e-tests/#macos-support)** -- Commercial hosted testing service with macOS WebDriver support.
